The maintenance committee looks after the general maintenance of the hostel, so that it can be a place where the students can live comfortably. We have various facilities made available for the students to use, some are:-<br>
<p>
<b>Lounge :-</b> The stairs just right to the hall manager's leads to the lounge, which has T.T. table, library, a music room, and comp room.</p>
<p>
<b>T.V. Room :-</b> The T.V room is just connected with the mess.Besides having a big screen T.V., it has newspapers, bucket chairs, and one window of canteen is accessible to students from this room.It becomes an ideal place for students to relax after a long day at lectures.</p>
<p>
<b>Washing and Ironing Room :-</b> room no. 45-46 of the hostel, here every hostelite can get their clothes washed and ironed.</p>
<p>
<b>Other facilities include :-</b> Pool room,Gym room,Xerox shop.</p>

All these facilities are for hostelites and we expect that all students use them responsibly, so that all of us can make the best use of these..<br>
