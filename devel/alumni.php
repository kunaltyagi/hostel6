		        		<h3 class="heading">Welcome to Hostel-6, The Vikings!!</h3>
		        		<p>It is a pleasure to welcome you to the website of a place which once used to be your second home.
						A place where you learned how to live,how to set priorities in life, how to rise, how to make a special position in the society and the hearts of people. Opening the Hostel-6’s webpage to check for your hostel’s current happenings itself is a sign of nostalgia for the good old IIT life.
						</p>
						<p>So, the SARC team and the Hostel Council now collaborate and work to to make Student Alumni Relations even stronger. Starting with Reunions...</p>
						<p>The Hostel reunion was held for the first time in the institute 4 years ago! Various events planned for the reunions included a fun filled antakshari for both the alumni and the students and events which facilitated them to recall the past and even made them nostalgic for the good old days</p>
						<p>This year the reunion promises to be even bigger and better. The Hostel council and SARC plan to extend their horizons by having Alumni Sports meet and cultural events and buddy talks among others. Details regarding these will be updated soon.</p>
